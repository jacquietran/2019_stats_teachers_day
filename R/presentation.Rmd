## A general workflow for sports analytics

--

**Determine the need** through collaboration

--

Articulate the need as a **question**

--

Scope out the **"minimum viable product"**

--

Allow time for **peer review**

--

**Communicate insights** in appropriate ways

# Let's work with some sports data!

---

<br />
This exercise uses a publicly available data set that includes **all podium results from the Winter Olympic Games from 1924 to 2014, inclusive**.

<center>

The `winter` data set is downloadable from this link:  
**[https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games/data](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games/data)**

``` {r demo1_import_data_part_1a, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

# The {here} package helps point to a PROJECT-specific file directory,
# rather than a location specific to YOUR personal computer, like:
# C:\Users\YourName\Documents
library(here)

# The {readr} package is efficient for reading (importing) CSVs
library(readr)

# Import the data into your R session

  here("data/winter.csv"), col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL)

It depends on **perspective**, **priorities**, and **roles**.

## Activity

Imagine you are in one of these roles: athlete, coach, performance analyst, or performance director. Think: **What matters to me in this role?**

---

## Activity

Think about and / or note down **your initial questions** about the data set we're working with, which contains all podium results from the Winter Olympic Games from 1924 to 2014, inclusive.

---

## Activity

**Discuss** in small groups, then we'll share with the wider group.

- I am an / a [ athlete | coach | analyst | performance director ]
- What matters to me is ...
- The kinds of questions I am interested in are ...

---

## A worked example

I am a **performance director** for a Winter Olympics sport in NZ.

--

What matters to me is **keeping an eye on competitor countries** to benchmark ourselves and learn from what our opposition does well.

--

The kinds of question I am interested in are **about how other countries have performed** at the Winter Olympics, especially those that have **favourable environmental conditions** for training and competing.

## **How many gold medals** were won by
## **Canada, Norway, and Sweden** at the
## **last five Winter Olympic Games**, up to 2014?

---

## Subset the data

To answer this question, we create a data subset that focuses only on:

- Gold medal results

--

- Athletes from Canada (CAN), Norway (NOR), or Sweden (SWE), and

--

- Results from the five Winter Olympics between 1998 to 2014, inclusive.

``` {r demo1_subset_data_part_1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

# The {dplyr} package includes useful data manipulation functions
library(dplyr) #<<

# Subset the data
gold_medal_comparison <- winter %>%
  filter(Medal == "Gold"
         & Country %in% c("CAN", "NOR", "SWE")
         & Year >= 1998)

```

---
class: middle

``` {r demo1_check_subset_part1b, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

head(gold_medal_comparison, n = 8) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

---

## Wrangle the data

In the `winter` data set, the data is structured such that **one row is one medal-winning athlete, per country, per year**.

However...

--

- Team events (e.g., bobsleigh, curling) comprise multiple athletes, and

--

- Within teams that achieve a podium finish, each athlete is awarded a medal.

--

For this analysis, we need to wrangle the data to get it into a format where one row represents **one gold medal per event, per country, per year**.

---

## Create an 'identifier' variable

We can use these existing variables to create a unique ID for each gold medal won per country per event:

- Year
- Sport
- Discipline
- Country
- Gender
- Event

---

## Check the new variable

``` {r demo1_wrangle_data_part_1, echo = FALSE}

gold_medal_comparison <- gold_medal_comparison %>% #<<
  mutate(
    unique_event_ID =
      paste(Year, Sport, Discipline, Country, Gender, Event, sep = "_")
    )

```

``` {r demo1_wrangle_data_part_3a, echo = FALSE}

gold_medal_comparison %>%
  select(unique_event_ID) %>%
  head(n = 9) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

---

## Identify and omit rows with duplicate IDs

...so that one row = one gold medal per event, per country, per year.

--

``` {r demo1_wrangle_data_part_5e, echo = FALSE}

# This code chunk will evaluate but not display
gold_medal_comparison <- gold_medal_comparison %>%
  mutate(duplicates = duplicated(unique_event_ID)) %>%
  filter(duplicates == FALSE) %>%
  select(Year, City, Sport, Discipline, Country, Event, Medal)

# Check the data
head(gold_medal_comparison) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

---
class: center, middle

Now we have tidy data in the format we need for analysis!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacquietran/2019_stats_teachers_day/master/images/rickandmorty.gif" />

---

## Calculate gold medal totals

We use the wrangled data to calculate the **total number of gold medals** won by **Canada, Norway, and Sweden** at each of the **Winter Games between 1998 and 2014**.

---

## Calculate gold medal totals

From this...

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_1a, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

# Calculate total number of gold medals per team per Winter Games
head(gold_medal_comparison) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

---

## Calculate gold medal totals

...to this:

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_1b, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

# Calculate total number of gold medals per team per Winter Games
gold_medal_totals <- gold_medal_comparison %>%
  group_by(Year, City, Country) %>%               #<<
  summarise(gold_medal_total = length(Medal)) %>%
  ungroup()

gold_medal_totals %>%
  head(n = 7) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

---

Go beyond tables and make visual interpretation easier!
